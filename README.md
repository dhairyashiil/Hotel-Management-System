# Hotel-Management-System
Hotel Management System - This is a Java-based project for a hotel management system. The system is designed to manage hotel room reservations and customer check-ins and check-outs. It uses JDBC statements to communicate with a SQL database that stores the hotel's data.

The project has been developed as part of an internship program and showcases various features of Java programming and database management. 

The repository contains the source code and relevant files required to run the application. You can download or clone the repository to your local machine and run the application from there.

We hope this project will serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in learning Java programming, database management, and software development in general. Please feel free to contribute to the project or provide feedback on how we can improve it.
